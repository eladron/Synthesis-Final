This example shows the ability to synthesize a number where the program has multiple asserts.
The program:
```
a := 9 ; a := a + ?? ; assert a > 9 ; a := 11 ; a := a - ?? ; assert a < 11 
```
The output:
'''
The synthesizer will find that 1 will satisfy the assert.
'''
The command line:
```
python3 .\src\Synthesizer.py -p='program.txt'
