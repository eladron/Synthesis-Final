This example shows how the synthesizer will not find a number when the loop unrolling argument is not large enough.
The program:
```
b := a ; while a < (b + 3996) do ( c := a ; a := a + ?? ; assert (a < (c + 1001)) ; b := b + 1)
```
The output:
'''
The synthesizer will not find a number no matter the bounds because the loop unrolling argument is not large enough.
'''
The command line:
```
python3 .\src\Synthesizer.py -p='program.txt' -pbe -if='input.xlsx' -of='output.xlsx' -lu=2 -ub=1000
