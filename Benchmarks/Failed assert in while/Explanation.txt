This example shows the limitaion to synthesize successfully when the linv isn't informative.
The program:
```
a := 10 ; b := 10 ; while a < 20 do ( a := a + ??; b := b + 1; assert a > b)
```
The loop invariant:
'''
a < 20
'''
The output:
'''
The synthesizer will not find a nubmer that satisfy the assert no matter the bounds.
'''
The command line:
```
python3 .\src\Synthesizer.py -p='program.txt' -lf='fail_assert_in_while.json'
