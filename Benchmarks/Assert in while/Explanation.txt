This example shows the ability to synthesize a number where the program has assert inside a while loop.
The program:
```
a := 10 ; b := 10 ; while a < 20 do ( a := a + ??; b := b + 1; assert a > b)
```
The loop invariant:
'''
a >= b
'''
The output:
'''
The synthesizer will find that 2 will satisfy the assert.
'''
The command line:
```
python3 .\src\Synthesizer.py -p='program.txt' -lf='assert_in_while.json'
